# GDM Login Background

## Aim
Simple project to change background on GDM Login screen for Ubuntu 20.04 and above.


## How to
Just download the appImage, right click on it, click on permission tab and check the checkbox.
Then double click on the app and drag'n'drop an image.
It'll appear below after a second, then you can click the "check" icon to update your background.

Since this is an operation requiring root access, you'll be prompt to type your password.

This app requires libglib2.0-dev-bin to work properly, you'll see a message inviting you to install it, if you do not already have it on your system.
